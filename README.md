# Goal
The goal of the final assignement of this course was to recreate a retro game using our own little game engine.
We received a very bare bone starting template and during the semester we would improve it bit by bit using the 
things we learned in class.

# Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
The game that was assigned to me was Dig Dug, a 2D grid-based game where the player would have to eradicate all the monsters
lurking underneath the ground. To do this the player digs though the dirt and blows up the enemies using a little pump.

# Experience
I've learned quite a lot from creating my own game engine.
From implementing patterns to keeping my code maintainable, I've seen it all.
I've also noticed that I still have a lot to learn to be able to come a better programmer.

# Final thoughts
While the engine is nowhere near perfect and the game itself isn't as polished as I wanted it to be,
I'm still happy with the final result I've gotten.
