# Goal
The goal of the final assignement of this course was to recreate a game to your choosing using the framework we received.
The framework had complete gameplay functionality, but we had to complete the rendering pipeline throughout the semester.

# Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
I decided to recreate Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for the PC, since this is the very first game I played myself.
I recreated a part of the Diffindo Challenge area of the game where the player has to push snails onto pressure plates
to be able to get to the first star of the level (which also is the only star in my version).

# Experience
I never realized that the rendering pipeline could be so broad, and I only scratched the surface as well.
It left me really intrigued though, I found it very fun to learn about a certain concept and try to implement it.
I might even jump further in this graphics-hole and see which other concepts are still left to explore.

# Final thoughts
While everything is rendered like it supposed to be, there's still some rough edges here and there.
The gameplay itself isn't quite as good as I hoped it to be as.
But due to time constraints for the exam and general exhaustion I had to leave the game as is.

Nonetheless I learned quite a lot, and I would like to learn more about rendering techniques.
